# EcoBank - Portfolio of an Ecological Digital Bank
EcoBank is a portfolio project that simulates a digital bank focused on sustainable and modern solutions. Created as a demonstration of skills in development, design, and financial technology, EcoBank offers a practical view of what the interface and services of a sustainability-driven digital bank would look like.

Portfolio Objective:
This project aims to present concepts in:

Front-end and Back-end Development: User-friendly interface and robust architecture.
UI/UX Design: Focus on user experience with a clean and intuitive layout.
Financial API Integration: Simulation of transactions and account management.
Data Security: Best practices in encryption and protection of sensitive information.
Sustainable Efficiency: Strategies to minimize environmental impact through digital solutions.
Built with Spring Boot:
EcoBank is developed using Spring Boot, a powerful Java-based framework. The project utilizes the following dependencies:

Spring Web: To build RESTful APIs and web services.
Spring Data JPA: For data persistence and integration with relational databases.
Spring Security: To ensure secure authentication and authorization.
Spring WebSocket: Enabling real-time communication for chat functionality.
Thymeleaf: For rendering server-side HTML views.
H2 Database: As the in-memory database for development and testing.
Spring Messaging: For handling messaging protocols and communication within the chat.
STOMP Protocol: For enabling communication between clients and the server through WebSockets.

This project is not a real product but rather a showcase of skills and concepts in sustainable financial technology.
